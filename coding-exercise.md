# Appointment Management Service

Please create a simple application with a REST API that can store and manage appointments for a car service center. Appointments should be persisted in a datastore. Please create the data model that you feel is appropriate for the task at hand.

The application should have REST endpoints that do the following:

* Delete appointments from the database.
* Create new appointments.
* Update the status of an existing appointment.
* Retrieve a specific appointment from the database.
* Retrieve all appointments that are scheduled between a date range and sorted by price.

Additionally an appointment scheduler function should create new appointments at a random interval.

## Technologies to consider

* Language of choice (Java, C#, node.js, etc.)
* Command line build systems (Maven, Gradle, npm, etc.)
* Datastore of choice
* Docker/Kubernetes
* Unit testing framework (Mocha, JUnit, etc.)
* CI/CD Orchestration (Jenkins, Ansible, etc.)

It is okay to include other libraries/dependencies as necessary, but be prepared to discuss with your interviewer.
